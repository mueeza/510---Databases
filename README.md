CPS510 SQL Project: Employee Clocking DBMS

This DMBS was developed over a series of weeks in which many changes and improvements were made. This project served as a way for us to get familiar with SQL and other concepts like relational algebra, ER diagrams, bash, and normalization techniques for tables. Note the files under this repo are not ordered by week.
